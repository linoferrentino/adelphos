## What is it?

adelphos is at its core a system that enables users of different
regions, even countries, to share goods and services using in
part a virtual currency and in part real currency, either real
(in cash) or deferred (an IOU).

The system exploits the natural human trust between families to
grow fractally similar structures at other levels.

## Differences from other systems like LETS or Ripple

In the LETS system the curreny is virtual, the users exchange
credits but those credits do no exit the system.

In the Ripple system there is a mesh of interconnections, but
there is not a fractal structure.


## 🏡 Economy and Trust Within Families

Let’s begin by understanding how trust and economy function in a family.

Despite cultural differences, most families share two universal traits:
- **Mutual trust**
- **Shared responsibility**

Examples:
- Families divide chores and maintain shared spaces.
- Parents give children pocket money.
- Spouses often share a joint account for bills and expenses.

If a child breaks a window, the parents pay.  
If a spouse takes on debt, the other may be liable — even with separate assets.

### 🧠 Key Principles

1. **Members are responsible for each other’s debts.**  
2. **The family acts as a single economic unit.**

This is the foundation of **Level Zero (L0) Trust** in ἀδελφός.

---

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Level Zero (L0): The Family Unit

In ἀδελφός, a Level Zero group is not necessarily a biological family, but it behaves like one.

### Characteristics:
- A shared ledger for all members (no individual accounts)
- Full mutual responsibility for all debts (Reedemable  and unreedemable)
- The external world sees the group as a **single entity**

Each member is liable for all money issued by the group — whether **redeemable (RM)** or **unredeemable (UM)**.

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Level One (L1): The cohort

Level One represents our **closest friends** — those we trust deeply but don’t
share daily life with.

### Key Differences from L0:
- No shared living space or joint account
- Trust exists, but is **limited to certain transactions**

#### 🧾 Example

> Alice and Lucy are teenage friends.  

> They buy each other small gifts — earrings, bracelets — without tracking who owes what.  

> But when Lucy wants to sell her school books to Alice for $200, she expects
> real money or a formal promise (RM).

### Characteristics of L1:
- Not part of the same family (L0)
- Willing to accept RM or UM for **larger expenses**
- For small exchanges, trust is informal and untracked

In adelphos the level one is called the cohort.

## 🧬 Self-Organizing Nature of ἀδελφός


## 🚫 Not a Ponzi Scheme

adelphos is the opposite of a Ponzi Scheme.

In a Ponzi Scheme there is a pyramid, the top is fed by the
bottom, but the top does not do anything, it sits like a
parasite.

Instead in adelphos the top is responsible for the debts of the
previous levels.


# 🤝 Trust in ἀδελφός

Trust, like love, escapes a formal definition. However, in **ἀδελφός**, trust is measured as the amount of money we are willing to postpone for a person or group.

---

## 💡 What Is Trust?

If Alice sells a used phone to Bob for $300 and Bob promises to pay in a month, Alice is trusting Bob for **$300 over 30 days**.

Thus, trust is a **function of two variables**:
- **Quantity** (amount of money)
- **Time** (duration of delay)

In real life, longer delays often require **interest** to compensate for risk. For example:

> Bob promises Alice that if she waits one year, he will pay her $310 — a 3% interest.

---

## 📐 Trust as a Measurable Concept

In ἀδελφός, trust is defined as the **amount of delayed money** we are willing to sacrifice in the present.

When I receive a payment from someone, I give **trust** to them, and that trust is proportional to the **credit** I extend.

### 🧾 Example

> Suppose we sell a used car to our wife’s best friend, Lucy.  
> The market price is €4,000. Lucy has only €3,500.  
> We accept €3,500 in cash and €500 as an IOU.  
> The trust ratio is:  
> `500 / 4000 = 12.5%`

This 12.5% represents the **trust** we place in Lucy. The system records this IOU, and the trust becomes quantifiable.

---

## 🧭 Philosophy of Trust in ἀδελφός

Trust is the **amount of credit** I’m willing to accept from another party. ἀδελφός does not aim to replace national currencies entirely — it encourages a gradual shift from **scarcity-based money** to **credit-based exchange**.

Each participant defines their own **trust threshold** when joining the system, limiting their exposure and risk.

---

## 📊 The Axiom of ἀδελφός

We use a **logarithmic scale** to model trust, because doubling the amount of credit doesn’t necessarily double the trust.

### 🔺 Axiom:
> _One unit of trust equals one unit of currency exchanged._

To represent currency generically, we use the Greek letter **Tao (τ)**.

---

## 🧮 The Human Unit

Currencies vary widely in value. The **human unit** is the smallest amount of money that can buy something meaningful in a given country.

Examples:
- In pre-Euro Italy, 1 Lira was meaningless — but **1,000 Lire** could buy a coffee.
- In hyperinflated economies, the human unit might be **1 million** of the local currency.
- In the US, **$1** is a usable human unit.

We use the human unit to compute **trust as a dimensionless value**.

---

## 📏 The Trust-bel: Unit of Trust

Trust is measured using the **trust-bel (tb)**, defined as:

    trust-bel = 10 * log10(τ / τ_HV)



Where:
- `τ` = amount of postponed currency
- `τ_HV` = human value of currency

---

### 🧮 Example 1: USA

Alice lends Bob **$100**.  
Human value in the US = **$1**


trust-bel = 10 * log10(100 / 1) = 10 * 2 = 20 tb


---

### 🧮 Example 2: Italy (pre-Euro)

Anna lends Bruno **1,000,000 Lire**.  
Human value = **1,000 Lire**

trust-bel = 10 * log10(1,000,000 / 1,000) = 10 * 3 = 30 tb


Even though the amount increased fivefold (from $100 to €500), the trust-bel only increased by 10 units — reflecting the logarithmic nature of trust.

---

## 🧠 Trust in Practice

In ἀδελφός, trust-bel will be used throughout the system. The **human value** is approximated using the average exchange rate between the local currency and the dollar.

Examples:
- For Yen, we use **100 Yen** as the human unit, since $1 ≈ ¥100.


# 💰 Money in ἀδελφός

In ἀδελφός, money can be either:

- **Real money** — traditional currency exchanged outside the system
- **Deferred money** — credit exchanged within the system

Deferred money comes in two forms:
- **Redeemable Money (RM)** — credit with a specified due date
- **Unredeemable Money (UM)** — credit without a defined repayment date

---

## 🔁 Redeemable Money (RM)

Redeemable money functions like an IOU: a promise to pay a specific amount by a future date (e.g., “after 180 days” or “after one year”).

Each user defines their **trust level** in ἀδελφός, which determines how much RM they’re willing to accept from others. This is calculated using the inverse of the trust-bel formula.

### 🧾 Example

> Alice wants to buy a used phone from Bob for $300.  
> Bob has registered in ἀδελφός with a trust level of **20tb**.  
> Using the inverse trust formula:
>
> ```
> RM_max = 10^(20 / 10) × τ_HV = 100 × $1 = $100
> ```
>
> Bob can accept **$100 in RM**. The remaining **$200 must be paid in cash**.

The cash exchange happens outside ἀδελφός. Bob certifies receipt of the $200, Alice confirms she received the phone, and ἀδελφός records the $100 IOU.

---

## 🔄 Using RM in the System

RM is **spendable** within ἀδελφός. Bob can use the $100 credit from Alice to purchase goods or services from other users — as long as their trust limits allow it.

### 🧾 Example

> Bob wants to take French lessons from Lucy, who charges **$20/hour** and has a trust level of **20tb**.  
> Bob books **3 hours** for **$60**.  
> Lucy accepts RM up to **$100**, so Bob pays entirely in RM.  
> He now has **$40 RM** remaining.

---

### 🧠 Observations

1. **Trust is relational**: Lucy must trust Alice (the original issuer of the RM) to accept Bob’s payment. This will be explored further in the discussion of **Level Zero and Level One groups**.

2. **Credit is cumulative**: If Lucy already holds $60 in RM, her remaining trust capacity is $40.  
   > If John wants 5 hours of lessons for $100, he can only pay **$40 in RM** and must cover the rest with **real money**.

---

## 🌀 Unredeemable Money (UM)

UM works similarly to RM, but without a defined repayment date. Each user has separate trust levels for RM and UM — typically, trust in UM is lower due to its non-convertibility.

Though UM may be convertible in special cases (to be discussed later), for now:

> **1 UM = 1 RM in system value**

---

## ⚖️ Key Differences Between RM and UM

- **Interest**: RM may accrue interest; UM does not.
- **Responsibility**:
  - Users are responsible for all RM and UM they issue.
  - They are **only responsible for RM** issued by friends they’ve invited into ἀδελφός.
