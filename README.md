## What is it?

adelphos is at its core a system that enables users of different
regions, even countries, to share goods and services using in
part a virtual currency and in part real currency, either real
(in cash) or deferred (an IOU).

The system exploits the natural human trust between families to
grow fractally similar structures at other levels.

## Differences from other systems like LETS or Ripple

In the LETS system the curreny is virtual, the users exchange
credits but those credits do no exit the system.

In the Ripple system there is a mesh of interconnections, but
there is not a fractal structure.
