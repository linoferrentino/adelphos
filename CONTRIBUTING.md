# Contributing in adelphos


Thanks for your interest in the project.

This project was started long ago (in 2008!) but it
stayed as a proof of concept written in Perl.

After many years I have decided to rewrite it because
I think that its ideas are nice.

If you want to participate I will gladly accept your
contribution to this project which will remain under
GPL.

So your efforts will not be in vain, but will contribute
to a piece of software which I think will do good to
the world.

## What I particulary need.

I need people with skills in web and mobile development.

It would be nice to have an adelphos app in android or
IOS but I do not have the skills and the capacity to do that.

I am strong in developing the base daemon in C.

An help in database programming would be nice.

For now adelphos uses sqlite3, but probably later
we will need a full relational server.
